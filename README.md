Hi, I'm Bridget and I'm currently studying psychology at Northeastern University. 

I'm interested in social psychology and technology design; in the future, I hope to research how technology can be molded to be more suitable to human use. 

This is my first website design, and I'm planning on adding/expanding as I continue to work on new projects.
